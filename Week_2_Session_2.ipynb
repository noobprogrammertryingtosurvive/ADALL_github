            "1. **Brand**: The brand of the laptop (e.g., Acer).\n",
            "2. **Model**: The specific model of the laptop.\n",
            "3. **CPU**: The processor model.\n",
            "4. **GPU**: The graphics card model.\n",
            "5. **RAM_GB**: The amount of RAM in gigabytes.\n",
            "6. **Storage_Type**: The type of storage (e.g., SSD, HDD).\n",
            "7. **Storage_GB**: The storage capacity in gigabytes.\n",
            "8. **Touchscreen**: Whether the laptop has a touchscreen (True/False).\n",
            "9. **Weight_kg**: The weight of the laptop in kilograms.\n",
            "10. **Screen_Size_inch**: The size of the screen in inches.\n",
            "11. **Discount_percent**: The discount percentage applied to the laptop.\n",
            "12. **Price_SGD**: The price of the laptop in Singapore dollars.\n",
            "13. **Brand_Discount**: Discount specific to the brand.\n",
            "14. **Member_Discount**: Discount available for members.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Data Analysis Tasks\n",
            "Here are some potential tasks we could perform on this dataset:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
            "   - Convert categorical variables such as `Brand`, `Model`, `CPU`, `GPU`, and `Storage_Type` into numerical representations using one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n",
            "   - Handle any missing values or outliers that could skew the analysis.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:\n",
            "   - Visualize the distribution of laptop prices.\n",
            "   - Analyze the relationship between features and prices using scatter plots and correlation matrices.\n",
            "   - Use box plots or violin plots to examine the impact of different brands or models on price.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
            "   - Create new features that might impact pricing, such as the ratio of RAM to storage or a combined feature that indicates performance based on CPU and GPU.\n",
            "   - Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Modeling for Prediction**:\n",
            "   - Use linear regression as a baseline model to predict `Price_SGD` using features such as `CPU`, `RAM_GB`, `Storage_GB`, etc.\n",
            "   - Lee us know if we need to implement regression metrics such as RMSE, MAE, or R² to assess model performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Classification Task**:\n",
            "   - If the intention is to classify laptops into price categories (e.g., low, medium, high), one could use logistic regression or decision trees.\n",
            "   - Define price ranges and categorize the data accordingly before training classification models.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Model Evaluation**:\n",
            "   - Evaluate the model's performance using confusion matrix, classification report, or ROC-AUC scores for classification tasks.\n",
            "   - For regression tasks, use metrics like R² or adjusted R² to understand the model's explanatory power.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Possible Questions to Answer\n",
            "- How much does the type of CPU and GPU affect laptop prices?\n",
            "- Is there a significant price difference between laptops with SSD vs. HDD storage?\n",
            "- Do features like weight and screen size correlate with the price?\n",
            "- How do discounts influence the final retail price of laptops?\n",
            "\n",
            "This overview should help guide the analysis and modeling for the laptop prices dataset. If there's a specific direction or analysis you wish to take from here, let me know!\n"
